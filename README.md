- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SimulCat, I'm creating a repository to support the technical side of building and collaborating on simulation prefabs, and display models for #VRChat worlds that bring to life ideas realted to the interface between calssical and quantum theory. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about how to put together computation and shaders that will streamline wave, crystal, and molecular scattering models.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me Discord: simucat, VRChat K_Cat.
- âš¡ Fun fact: The particle probability distributions that are predicted by applying the Schrodinger equation to solve the double slit just evolve in free space exactly like particles undergoing classical 'Ballistic Diffusion'.
