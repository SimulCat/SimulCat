- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @SimulCat. I'm creating a repository for collaborating on simulations and prefabs for #VRChat worlds that bring ideas related to the interface between classical and quantum theory to life. 
- ðŸŒ± I'm learning to combine computation and shaders to streamline wave, crystal, and molecular scattering models.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me Discord: simucat, VRChat K_Cat.
- âš¡ Fun fact: The particle probability distributions that are predicted by applying the Schrodinger equation to solve the double slit evolve in free space exactly like particles scattering without interacting, a process known as 'Ballistic Diffusion'.
